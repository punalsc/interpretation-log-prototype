Highly conserved nucleotide and amino acid.  \nPACS2 in OMIM causes AD Early infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy 66.  this variant is in OMIM and has been reported by Olsen et al 2018 (PMID:\n    29656858) as a recurrent variant found in 14 unrelated individuals with a phenotype charaterised by epilepsy, global DD with or without autism, commom cerebellar dysgenesis and facial dysmorphism.  Mixed focal and generalised epilepsy occurred in neonatal period, controlled with difficulty in first yewar, but many improved in early childhood.  Phenotype seems to fit well with our patient although many of the facial/ dysmorphic features are not mentioned in our patient.  Olsen et al performed co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrating that PACS2 p.Glu209Lys interacted with a greater extent with client proteins (SIRT1 & HDAC1 and TRPV1).  This suggests that the PCS2 mutation reguces the ability of the prdicted autoregulatory domain to modulate the interaction between the PACS2 furin-binding regions and client proteins, which may disturb cellular function.  \nThis mutation and one other missense Asp304Asn are the only reported changes in this gene in HGMD.  \nHighlighted via email by Ellen Thomas at GeL as potentially significant.  PACS2 is in current ID panel (ver 2.504), but not ver 2.333 used for this patient - therefore in tier 3.  ",
